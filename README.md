# Serverless Calculator
This is the project realized for the Cloud Computing course (a.y. 23/24). We designed a server-less architecture to deploy an application with scalability, high availability and high responsiveness. To do so, we took advantage of the Amazon Web Services (AWS). All the information about our project are in the report.
